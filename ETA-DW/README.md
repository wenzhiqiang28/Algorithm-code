# Eye Tracking Analysis Project

This project contains algorithms for analyzing the relationship between eye-tracking data and expert scoring data using methods such as the Bayesian Best-Worst Method (BBWM), M-CRITIC-RP, and Grey-H Convex Correlation. It is designed to assess how visual cognition and layout aesthetics are coupled in design interfaces.

## Description

The goal of this project is to simulate eye-tracking data and expert scores for different layouts and apply the following algorithms:

1. **BBWM (Bayesian Best-Worst Method)**: Compute subjective weights for expert scores based on best and worst criteria.
2. **M-CRITIC-RP**: Calculate objective weights using distance correlation coefficients and standard deviations.
3. **Grey-H Convex Correlation**: Analyze the coupling relationship between visual cognition and layout aesthetics.

## Installation

To run the project, you need Python 3.7+ and the required libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
